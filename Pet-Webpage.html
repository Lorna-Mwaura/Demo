    <h2>Testing my creativity</h2>
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    <p>So my favourite pet is a dog. At home, I have a dog which is a chiwawa by the name Lexy. Not only is it a
        cute-little dog, but it is also an obedient dog. It is a good companion especially when I'm feeling lonely. I
        really love lexy.</p>
    <p>There are other pets at home, but Lexy is my favourite.Some of this pets at home are</p>
